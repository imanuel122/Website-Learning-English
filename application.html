        <h2>Understanding Application Letter & CV</h2>
        <p>
          If you are going to apply any job, usually you need to write an
          application letter to state that you apply the job vacancy. In the
          application letter, you need to introduce yourself, mention the
          position you apply and argue how you will be the best person to fill
          the position. Along with application letter, you also need to attach
          some important documents like certificates and others.
        </p>
        <h2>Format of Application Letter</h2>
