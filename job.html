          dress pants and a nice blouse (for women)would be appropriate for the
          interview.

          perfume or strong body washes/sprays, Do not wear clothing that is too
          tight or too short, Do not wear open toed shoes or stilettos, Carry
          either a professional, conservative purse or attaché case.

          Do not use cologne or a strong smelling aftershave; If wearing a suit,
          choose gray, black, or navy with a coordinating shirt and professional
          tie; Empty your pockets; Wear a nice looking belt and matching shoes;
